It has been a while since the last post! This is the third part of a series of blog posts where I talk about the research highlights about GANs. Are you interested in knowing the origins? Check the [first part][fantasticI]. Or maybe you want to see how GANs went from "that face looks sort of real" to "holy shit that could be my neighbour"? The [second part][fantasticI] is for you. In this blog post we are going to see how GANs manage to generate more realistic images than real life.

#### What this post is not about
This is what you __won't__ find in this post:

* Complex technical explanations. Intuition comes first.
* Code (links to code for those interested, though).
* An exhaustive research list (you can already find one [here][GANpapers]).

#### What this post is about
* A summary of relevant topics about GANs, starting where I left it on the [previous post][fantasticII] (ProGANs).
* A lot of links to other sites, posts and articles so you can decide where to focus on.

Let's get a brief refresher from the last post. Or maybe not.

As always, here I describe in chronological order the GAN articles that have been a break-through in the field.
