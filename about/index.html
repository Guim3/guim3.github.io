	<p>Hey, I'm Guim!</p>
	<p>I'm interested in applying machine learning to solve real world problems.</p>

	<p>In May 2022 I joined Meta as a senior machine learning engineer. Opinions are my own.</p>
	
	<p>Some of the things I did in the past include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>(2018) I joined Bloomberg as a machine learning engineer, where I worked for four years applying AI to news (mainly ranking).</p></li>
		<li><p>(June 2017) I moved to London and joined a startup called Aframe, where I worked as a computer vision an deep learning engineer.</p></li>
		<li><p>(Dec 2016) I attended <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016">NIPS 2016</a>, where my research about <a href="../projects/#icgan"> Invertible conditional GANs (IcGAN)</a> was accepted and selected for a presentation at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nips2016adversarial/">Workshop on Adversarial Training</a>.</p></li>
	</ul>
		
	<p>I graduated from Autonomous University of Barcelona in September 2016 with an M.Sc. in Computer Vision and a B.Sc. in Computer Science, both with honors. I also was awarded the best final degree project and best master thesis. During that time, I interned at the <a href="http://www.cvc.uab.es/">Computer Vision Center</a> for 10 months doing machine learning research projects.</p>
		
	<p>My personal interests include playing various instruments and dancing.</p>
